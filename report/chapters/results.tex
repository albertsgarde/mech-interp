We start by looking at the performance of the N2G models across the two populations: MLP neurons and SAE latents.
For each feature, we calculate the recall, precision, and F1-score of the N2G model trained on that feature along with the density of that feature, i.e. on what proportion of samples does its activation exceed some threshold.
Table \ref{tab:distributions} and figure \ref{fig:distributions} shows the distributions of these statistics across the two populations.
A two-sample bootstrap test shows that the means of the distributions are different for all statistics with $p<0.0001$.
This is also indicated by the figures, but more interesting is that while the statistics for MLP features are roughly unimodal, the statistics for SAE features are bimodal.
There seems to be a cluster of high-scoring features in the SAE population that is not present in the MLP population.
Figure \ref{fig:recall_precision} confirms this by showing that there is a set of SAE features with both near perfect recall and near perfect precision.

An interesting question is whether the performance of the N2G model is related to the density of the feature.
Figure \ref{fig:density} shows the distribution of feature densities across the two populations, first for all features and then for only features with an F1-score above 0.5.
Interestingly, the high density features of the SAE almost disappear when only considering high-scoring features, which indicates that these are hard to interpret.
Instead we get that the high-scoring SAE features are of lower density, around $10^{-2}$.

Lastly, figure \ref{fig:density_f1} shows the relationship between density and F1-score for the two populations.
This mainly confirms what we have already seen.
