\section{Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item No ultra low density cluster. This is especially weird since the SAE should be roughly the one used in Neel Nanda's replication.
    \item Instead we have an ultra high density cluster.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item N2G is purely syntactical, though this can represent other stuff.
    \item OpenAI also use N2G
    \item Alternative method would be the othello gpt one
    \item Maybe could have used tinystories?
    \item
